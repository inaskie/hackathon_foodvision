# FoodVision - Connecting Europe by Food

## 🍽️ Project Overview
FoodVision is a culinary festival concept developed for the EUDRES Hackathon 2025 (Fulda Hub). The project addresses the challenge: **"How can we use cuisine to shape regional identities and connect Europe at the same time?"**

## 🎯 The Challenge
The Rhön region—a former Cold War borderland at the intersection of three German federal states—serves as a compelling backdrop for culinary reconciliation. FoodVision tackles growing nationalism in Europe by using food as a bridge between communities, proving that regional identity and European unity are not opposites, but complementary ingredients.

## 💡 Our Solution
FoodVision is a **Eurovision-inspired culinary festival** that:
- Rotates annually between European host countries (Year 1 in Fulda)
- Features fusion dishes combining local Rhön ingredients with European flavors
- Uses a democratic selection process: online submissions → semi-finals → live grand finale
- Operates on **Common Good Economy principles** (donations support local farmers, not profit)
- Creates cultural ambassadors who travel Europe to learn and teach culinary traditions

## 🌍 Key Features
- **Scalable Model**: Start with 9 countries, grow to all 37 Eurovision nations
- **Year-Round Engagement**: Pop-up events, online cook-alongs, free recipe database
- **Partnership Vision**: Collaboration with Eurovision Song Contest for cultural week programming

## 🎨 Brand Identity
- Logo inspired by Eurovision's playful style
- EUDRES color palette: Pink, Turquoise, Yellow, Burgundy
- Tagline: **"Taste the Future"** / **"Connecting Europe by Food"**

## 🏆 Impact Goals
✅ Counter nationalist tendencies through shared culinary experiences  
✅ Strengthen regional identity (Rhön) while building European solidarity  
✅ Support local producers through transparent, ethical economy  
✅ Preserve culinary heritage while celebrating cultural exchange  
✅ Position Fulda/Rhön as Europe's "culinary peace capital"
